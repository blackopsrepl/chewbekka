Posted: March 18, 2025  
At [Insert Company Name], we are passionately committed to fostering a vibrant, equitable, and intersectionally diverse workplace that celebrates every individual’s unique lived experiences. We are seeking an Inclusive Harmony Facilitator to join our dynamic, people-centric team in co-creating a culture of belonging, empowerment, and transformative allyship. This role is an opportunity to champion systemic inclusion while dismantling barriers to access and amplifying underrepresented voices in a safe, trauma-informed environment.
Who We Are:
We are a forward-thinking, values-driven organization dedicated to advancing justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (JEDIA) across all dimensions of identity, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, neurodiversity, ability, age, and cultural heritage. Our mission is to cultivate a workplace where every team member thrives authentically and contributes to our shared vision of collective liberation.
What You’ll Do:  
Partner collaboratively with cross-functional stakeholders to design and implement holistic inclusion strategies that center marginalized perspectives and promote psychological safety.  

Facilitate courageous conversations and learning experiences that foster cultural humility, dismantle unconscious bias, and nurture an anti-oppressive organizational ecosystem.  

Leverage data-driven insights to assess and enhance our JEDIA initiatives, ensuring alignment with our commitment to equity-centered outcomes.  

Serve as an empathetic advocate and resource for team members, providing trauma-sensitive support and amplifying their agency in shaping our culture.  

Co-develop accessible communication frameworks that honor diverse communication styles and eliminate exclusionary language or practices.

Who You Are:  
A compassionate change agent with a deep understanding of intersectionality and a demonstrated commitment to social justice and equity.  

Someone who brings 2+ years of experience in fostering inclusive environments, ideally within a people-focused or community-building context (lived experience is equally valued).  

A collaborative listener with strong emotional intelligence and the ability to navigate complex identities and perspectives with grace and authenticity.  

Comfortable with ambiguity and adept at holding space for growth, healing, and accountability in a fast-paced, evolving environment.  

Proficiency in inclusive language and restorative practices is a plus; fluency in multiple languages or non-traditional communication methods (e.g., ASL) is warmly welcomed.

Why Join Us:  
A flexible, hybrid/remote work model designed to honor your work-life integration and personal well-being.  

A robust benefits package, including unlimited PTO, mental health days, gender-affirming care, and equitable parental leave for all caregivers.  

Access to ongoing learning opportunities, including JEDIA training, mindfulness workshops, and affinity group participation.  

A transparent salary range of $65,000–$85,000, determined through an equity lens to ensure fairness across geographic and identity-based contexts.
