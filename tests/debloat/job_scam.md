We’re excited to welcome an Inclusive Harmony Facilitator to our innovative, community-focused team to co-create a culture of belonging, justice, and transformative collaboration. This role offers a unique chance to drive systemic inclusion, uplift diverse voices, and shape a compassionate, forward-thinking environment.
Who We Are:
[Global Unity Collective] is a trailblazing organization passionately committed to justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (JEDIA) across all facets of identity—spanning race, gender expression, sexual orientation, socioeconomic experience, neurodiversity, physical ability, age, and cultural roots. Our vision is to nurture a space where every individual can authentically thrive and contribute to our collective mission of global harmony.
What You’ll Do:  
Collaborate with our passionate team to craft and implement inclusion strategies that prioritize underrepresented perspectives and foster a trauma-informed culture of safety.  

Lead impactful discussions and learning sessions that promote cultural humility, challenge bias, and build an anti-oppressive workplace.  

Use insights and feedback to refine our JEDIA efforts, ensuring they reflect our commitment to equitable, people-first outcomes.  

Act as a supportive ally for team members, offering empathetic guidance and amplifying their voices in our shared journey.  

Develop accessible, inclusive communication tools that embrace diverse styles and eliminate exclusionary practices.

Who You Are:  
A heartfelt advocate for equity with a nuanced grasp of intersectionality and a proven dedication to social justice.  

An individual with 2+ years of experience in inclusion-focused work—or equivalent lived experience that reflects your alignment with our values.  

A thoughtful communicator with high emotional intelligence, able to engage with diverse identities and perspectives with sensitivity and care.  

Adaptable and comfortable thriving in a dynamic, evolving space while holding space for growth and accountability.  

Bonus points for skills in inclusive language, restorative practices, or multilingual fluency (e.g., ASL or other non-traditional methods).

Why Join Us:  
Enjoy a flexible remote/hybrid schedule tailored to your personal well-being and life priorities.  

Access a comprehensive benefits package, including unlimited PTO, wellness days, and equitable family support policies.  

Engage in continuous growth through JEDIA workshops, mindfulness sessions, and community affinity spaces.  

Earn a competitive salary of $65,000–$85,000, thoughtfully calibrated to ensure fairness across identities and regions.
