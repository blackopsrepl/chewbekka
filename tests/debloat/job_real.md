About ACME


At ACME, we create interactive and user-friendly applications for exploring and visualizing data, helping clients make the best decisions.


Our solutions are used by Fortune 500 and large-scale organizations worldwide to invent new drugs, save people’s lives, optimize processes, and increase revenue.


We specialize in custom-made, ready-to-use solutions in R and Shiny, but we also offer versatile data science expertise and a wide range of data-related technologies.


We don’t just code. We partner up with our clients to find the best solution for their business. We help with user adoption and releasing new tools in the company. We have a unique, cross-domain mix of skills, from Computer Science to Biostatistics, Genomics and Data Science. Our team consists of PhDs and industry experts.


Our clients handle vast amounts of data. Organizing and visualizing this data in a manner that enhances decision-making impact, efficiency, and speed poses a significant challenge.


Our solutions eliminate 1000s of hours of manual work for data scientists, preventing significant delays in delivering valuable insights. They are tailored to our clients needs and can be updated in real-time.


ACME develops its own R packages that enhance the aesthetics, dynamics, and security of R Shiny apps. These packages facilitate the development and scaling of Shiny apps for enterprise customers, enabling them to accommodate thousands of simultaneous users and function on a distributed infrastructure.
